To Laksmi Dewi Fortuna,

In the quiet moments of my day, I always knew that meeting you was one of the best thing in my life and choosing to be your friend was one of my best decision I've ever made. Thank you for choosing me as well.

I will constantly be by your side or even at your back, you'll always have me, even during your toughest times, so you never have to pretend you're okay when you're not.

I want to see you live your life happily, I hope the universe takes care of you no matter what, I pray we both win in life and in everything we do and wish for.

So yeah, meeting you was like finding a part of me I didn't know was missing. Everything's better with you. Everything has been better since you. I wish I could wrap you in a warm hug and let you know just how much I grateful for your presence. I've never liked a soul quite the way I like you. I could listen to you talk forever and wouldn't complain at all, it'll never bore me.

Just so you know, I always try to take all your recommendations seriously, I wanna know why you like stuff.

You're indeed a sunshine in human form, Mi, I hope the sun always rests gently on your shoulders.

-Willy
