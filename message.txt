To Laksmi Dewi Fortuna,

In the quiet moments of my day, I often realize that meeting you was one of the best things to ever happen to me—and choosing to be your friend remains one of the greatest decisions I’ve ever made. Thank you for choosing me too.

I’ll always be by your side, or even behind you, ready to support you. You’ll never have to face your toughest moments alone, and you don’t have to pretend you’re okay when you’re not.

I want to see you live a happy life. I hope the universe takes care of you, no matter what. I pray that we both succeed in life and in everything we pursue.

Meeting you was like finding a missing piece of myself. Everything feels brighter with you in my life. Everything has been better since you came along. I wish I could wrap you in a warm hug and show you just how grateful I am for your presence. I’ve never connected with anyone the way I do with you. I could listen to you talk forever and never grow tired of it—every word matters to me.

I may not be the best friend you’ve ever had, but I promise to always give you my best. I want you to know you don’t have to go through hardships alone. When everything feels overwhelming, you can run to me. I’m here for you, and I want you to feel safe with me. I won’t judge you, and I won’t pressure you to talk before you’re ready. If all you need is silent companionship, I’ll be that person for you. It’s okay if you don’t have all the answers right now, or if you need time to figure things out. You’re allowed to feel lost.

But remember, you don’t have to carry the weight alone. If running away seems like the only option, try running to me instead. I’ll help shoulder the burden so you don’t have to bear it all by yourself. When everything piles up and it feels like no one could possibly understand, know that you don’t have to worry about that with me. I’m not here to fix everything or offer unsolicited advice—just to listen, to give you a safe space, and to remind you that it’s okay to lean on someone else. You’ve already carried so much on your own.

So when the world feels like it’s closing in, and everything becomes too much, I hope you’ll remember this: You don’t have to face it alone. You can run to me, and I’ll be here—no questions, no expectations—just someone who cares deeply and wants you to be okay. Whenever you need me, I’m right here.

You’re allowed to fall apart sometimes. Just know that I’ll be here to help you pick up the pieces.

You truly are sunshine in human form, Mi. I hope the sun always rests gently on your shoulders.

—Willy
